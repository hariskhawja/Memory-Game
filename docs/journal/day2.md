# Journal - Day 2
Date: Tuesday, November 29, 2022

- Chose the Memory Game project, got it approved by the teacher
- Aritro started work on figuring out the wiring for the 8 bit shift register (75HC595)
  - The wiring for the shift register is somewhat complicated, so I (Aritro) worked on a TinkerCAD diagram before creating it in-person
  - I used [this article](https://lastminuteengineers.com/74hc595-shift-register-arduino-tutorial/) to understand more about it works 
- Byron and Haris started work on wiring the rest of the components (LEDs, buttons, Arduino, buzzer, etc.)
