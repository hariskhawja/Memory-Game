# Journal - Day 1
Date: Monday, November 28, 2022

- Indexed most of the components available in the classroom
- Came up with 10 ideas
- Three main ideas
  1. Memory Game
      - Components:
        - 7 segment display for score
        - 4 buttons, corresponding LEDs for memory portion
        - 1 button to reset game
        - Speaker / buzzer to play tones on success / failure
  2. Weather Station
      - Components:
        - ESP8266 (if possible), or Arduino with accompanying software 
        - Integration into home automation platforms (ex. MQTT)
        - Temperature / humidity sensor
        - 7 segment display to show current statistics (ex. temperature, humidity, etc.)
        - IR remote to toggle between things to show on the display
        - Records aggregate data
  3. 3D Radar
      - Components:
        - 2 servos
        - Ultrasonic sensor
        - Mostly software heavy (would require something like Unity for data visualization)
