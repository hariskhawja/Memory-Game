# Journal - Day 5
Date: Friday, December 2, 2022

- With the new idea of revising the circuit with the implementation of the CD4511, the team got to work in rewiring and re-programming
- This specific CD4511 had to utilize a cathode type 7 segment display rather than the currently used anode 7 segment display, so this component was of course replaced
- Byron and Haris worked to rewire the circuit by connecting both the Arduino Uno and the new cathode 7 segment display to the CD4511
- Aritro completed the full memory game program and finally uploaded to the Arduino Uno
- Byron and Haris began to strip the resistors and LEDs to make the circuit appear much more "cleaner" and organized
- Aritro also contributed to the circuit's aesethics by stripping all remaining voltage and ground wires
- The team had finally completed the entire project and noticed a significant difference in terms of consistency wit the CD4511
