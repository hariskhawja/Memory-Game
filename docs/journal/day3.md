# Journal - Day 3

- Aritro began to finish wiring up the 7-segment display with the 75HC595 IC on tinkerCAD; however, faced both connectivity and programming issues:
    - During the first trial of its usage, the 75HC595 had actually burned out and needed to be replaced
    - Afterwards, the 7-segment display had appeared to only display some numbers for unforeseen reasons at the time; Aritro utilized the Arduino's IDE serial monitor tool to debug by outputting the binary digits received by the 75HC595
- Byron and Haris began to close the circuit with all the corresponding wires:
    - All input wires from the Arduino Uno
    - The voltage and ground wires
    - The 75HC595 output/LED wires
- Byron and Haris also began to strip wires to make the circuit more organized and have a "cleaner" feel
- Overall gameplay was completed and worked; the synchronization of the buttons and the corresponding LEDs and buzzer tones, the generation of random sequences, and the level generation
